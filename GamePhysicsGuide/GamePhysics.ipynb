Most physics engines use a fixed timestep that does not vary, allowing for more accurate integration methods like Velocity-Verlet, which *does* conserve total energy and total momentum, and therefore garantee that the system won't suddenly gain a lot of kinetic energy and yeet itself to infinity, among other things."
